# Welcome to BofA Mobile Development Work Prep Program!
In this project, you will be coding a mortgage calculator. At this point, you should have already completed most of the planning and are ready to get into the coding!

## Project Specs
#### Your mortgage calculator should:
- Have a sign on screen that allows users to enter in a username and password to login
- A Homes Details screen with a list of houses for the users to select from; each house should have a photo and a price (extra information is encouraged!)
- When you select a house, you should be taken to the mortgage calculator screen. The screen should:
  * have the following input fields: down payment (text field), loan amount (text field), loan duration (dropdown or selection wheel)
  * have the following label information: house price (should match from Home's Details screen), current interest rate
  * Calculate button; when clicked should display the mortgage rate clearly to the user
